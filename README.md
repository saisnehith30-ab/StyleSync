## 📌 What is this project about?

StyleSense AI is an AI-powered fashion assistant that helps users choose the most suitable clothes based on their skin tone, body type, and personal appearance.

Users can upload their face and full-body photo, and the system will:
- Detect skin tone and body shape
- Suggest suitable colors and outfit styles
- Recommend patterns that match their appearance
- Show which colors to avoid
- Provide a Virtual Try-On feature to preview outfits
- Give shopping links from Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart

The main goal is to help people feel more confident by making smarter fashion choices.

## 💡 What motivated us to choose this idea?

Many people struggle to select clothes that actually suit them. Often, outfits look good online or on models but not on the person wearing them. This leads to confusion, poor fashion choices, and sometimes wasted money.

We wanted to solve a real-life problem by creating a smart AI solution that:
- Guides users in choosing the right colors
- Helps them see how outfits look before buying
- Makes online shopping more personalized

This idea combines AI, fashion, and technology to improve user confidence and decision-making.

## 🔍 How is it different from other platforms?

Most shopping platforms only show clothes on models and do not consider the user’s skin tone, body type, or personal appearance.

StyleSense AI is different because:
- It analyzes the user's real face and body
- Suggests personalized outfit colors based on skin tone
- Provides a Virtual Try-On experience
- Keeps the user's face, background, and pose unchanged
- Gives direct shopping links to suitable outfits

This makes the experience more realistic and personal compared to regular fashion websites.

## 🚀 Future Updates for the Website

We plan to improve and expand the platform with features like:

- AI fashion stylist chatbot
- Trend-based outfit suggestions
- Seasonal fashion recommendations
- Outfit rating system
- Save and compare outfits
- Mobile app version
- Integration with more shopping platforms
- Real-time camera-based try-on

These updates will make the platform smarter and more interactive.
